# Bio and Interests
I am a first year CS Grad here at UCLA and I am loving it here in LA. I am a travel freak and my dream is to explore the world. I feel that life is an empty book which needs to be filled with amazing experiences! Do you feel the same way?

Interests:
Travelling, Hiking, Music composing and trying out new stuff everyday!
