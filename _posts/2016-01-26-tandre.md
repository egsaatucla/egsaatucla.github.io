#Bio and Interests:
I research reactions between inorganic solids such as cement, minerals, and glass and aqueous electrolyte solutions. Outcomes enable production of infrastructure with lower environmental impact, as well as stabilized waste-forms with greater durability.

My interests include playing piano, volleyball, quilting, modular origami, graphic design, strategy board games, flower arranging, and sometimes video games.

#Roles and Goals at EGSA: 
To improve the aesthetic appeal of eGSA’s communications, in order to further the other key areas of eGSA’s mission via increased awareness of the existence of eGSA.
