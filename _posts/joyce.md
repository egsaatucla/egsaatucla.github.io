#Bio and Interests
I got my B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science from China, and came to the U.S. to pursue my Ph.D in Statistics. I developed a software for rendering Chinese paper-cut from portrait for my B.S. and did human perceptual study on digital art for my M.S. degree. I am quite interested in studying the mechanism of human perception and how to apply it in the design of intelligent machine.
