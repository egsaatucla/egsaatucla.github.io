# Bio and Interests
I am a PhD candidate (4th year MS/PhD, 2nd Year PhD) working on developing deployable, learning-enabled, and resource-constrained sensing systems. When I am not working, you will find me making music, jamming with my band, cooking, eating out, sightseeing and speeding down the CA freeways.
