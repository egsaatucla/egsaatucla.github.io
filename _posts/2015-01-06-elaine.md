#Bio and Interests
Elaine is a bioengineer who has ventured outside of her own department and become engaged in research in the UCLA Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry since she started her PhD program here in October 2014. She is developing exciting chemistry to conjugate various biological molecules such as sugars and peptides onto icosahedral boron clusters. 

She loves hiking, kayaking, playing the piano, and collecting stuffed animals. She also loves sharing the excitement of science with everyone, and hopes to inspire future scientists and engineers among the younger populations through fun outreach activities.
