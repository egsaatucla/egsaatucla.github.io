# Bio and Interests
I love to hang out with my family and friends and do sport activities such as sailing and hiking! I am also a big fan of Yoga and mindfulness practices. 

I am an NSF graduate research fellow working on novel microscale 3D printing approaches. I am also the president of MAE Graduate Council and try my best to bring a sense of community to our engineering school.
