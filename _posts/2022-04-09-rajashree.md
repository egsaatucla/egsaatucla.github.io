# Bio and Interests
Iâ€™m a fourth year PhD student working on sputtering of new semiconductor perovskites for communications and solar applications. I completed my undergraduate degree in ChemE from UC Berkeley. In my free time, I enjoy swing dancing, gardening, woodworking, and cuddling with my two pet bunnies.
