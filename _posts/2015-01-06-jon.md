Jon is a part of the UCLA Fusion Science and Technology Center where he specializes in modeling the thermomechanics and thermophysics of packed beds of ceramic pebbles for tritium breeders in fusion reactors. As much as he loves working on computers, he's even happier when playing or even just watching sports with his friends. That's why when he joined eGSA he became the Athletic Director to help promote intramural sports involvement with engineering grad students and arrange events to go watch the Clippers, Dodgers, Kings, or Galaxy (but not the Lakers -- he's from Phoenix and can't stand the Lakers). His PhD is scheduled to finish sometime in 2015.
