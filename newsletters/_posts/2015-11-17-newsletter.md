<b>II. Infosession - Summer Mentorship Opportunity: High School Summer Research Program Daily Lab Supervisor</b>

<b>Tuesday, December 1, 11:45am-12:30pm</b>

<b>11:45 am: Free food is served</b>

<b>12:00-12:30 pm: Presentation and Q&A</b>

<b>Boelter Hall 4760</b>

UCLA's High School Summer Research Program (HSSRP) is a rigorous 8-week program that immerses 70 determined high school students in engineering labs and provides them with workshops on conducting research and communicating it to the rest of the community through scientific posters and oral presentations. An essential component of this program is the set of graduate daily lab supervisors (DLS's) in each of these labs who mentor the students in their day-to-day lab work.

HSSRP currently lacks the means of guaranteeing dedicated, enthusiastic DLS's to guide our students. In past years we have recruited by the top-down approach (reaching out to professors, who recruit grad students from their lab). This year we look to the bottom-up approach where we increase awareness and directly recruit grad students who are interested in mentorship opportunities.

We invite you to come and learn about this incredible opportunity to establish a deep, enriching connection with an enthusiastic young mind at our HSSRP DLS infosession on Tuesday, December 1st In Boelter Hall 4760. Free food will be served at 11:45 am, followed by our presentation from noon-12:30, followed by Q&A. We would also like to invite our former DLS's to lunch but ask that they bring a guest who may be interested in helping with the 2016 program.
