<b>III. Hiking with GradSWE: The Old LA Zoo</b>

<b>Saturday, October 31, 9am - 3pm</b>

<b>Old LA Zoo, Griffith Park</b>
  
Join GradSWE for this easy, fun Halloween hike at the Old LA Zoo! The hike is a 4 mile loop with 500 ft elevation gain. The hike contains beautiful scenery and a great view of LA, along with a chance to explore the Old LA Zoo (including old lion enclosures and more)!
 
As this hike takes place on Halloween, costumes are highly recommended (and animal-themed costumes are strongly encouraged)!
 
As this is a short hike, we plan to go out to lunch following the hike.
