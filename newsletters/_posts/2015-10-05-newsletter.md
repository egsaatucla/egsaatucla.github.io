<b>I. Scavengineer Hunt + Ice-cream Social</b>

<b>Thursday, October 08, 5 - 7pm</b>

<b>UCLA South Campus</b>

The first Scavengineer hunt is here! Are you game?

Armed only with a sheet of clues, here's your chance to conquer all of UCLA South Campus. In an hour. Yes, you heard us right! Quick, form teams of 2 to 4 (preferably from different engineering streams – you'll want help to crack all those clues). Hang on to your thinking hats – it gets even better as you solve different tasks (logic puzzles, basic physics problems and decrypt some interesting clues). Sign up ASAP for only 30 to 35 teams will be let in and you don't want to miss out on this chance of a lifetime.

Plus we have gift cards to give away to the best two teams. You get to cool off at the end of this super-fun trail at the Ice cream Social
